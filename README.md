Kinematic Bicycle Project
==========================
Implementing a simulated kinematic bicycle model of an autonomous vehicle

By Ted Ivanac

## Longer Description
A reimplementation of my ROB 498 Autonomous Vehicles project in Python. 
This will simulate an autonomous vehicle using the Kinematic Bicycle set of vehicle dynamics equations, enhanced to include better realistic force modeling in the dynamics equations
